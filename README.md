# OpenGL Scene Project

## 🎮 Project Description

This project showcases a 3D scene rendered using **OpenGL**. It demonstrates fundamental graphics programming concepts including:

- Setting up an OpenGL context
- Rendering 3D objects
- Applying transformations (translation, rotation, scaling)
- Using lighting and shading techniques
- Handling camera movement and user input

The scene includes models, textures, lighting effects, and camera controls to navigate through the 3D environment.

## 🛠 Installing and Running the Project

1. Ensure you have the required OpenGL development libraries installed (e.g., GLFW, GLEW or GLAD).
2. Clone or download the project source code.
3. Build the project using your preferred build system (e.g., CMake, Makefile, or IDE project).
4. Run the executable to open the OpenGL window displaying the 3D scene.

## 🎯 How to Use

- Use keyboard and/or mouse controls to navigate the camera/view. (C, 1, 2, 3, arrow keys, WASD, mouse)
- Observe various objects rendered with lighting and shading.
- Interact with the scene (e.g., changing lighting, toggling objects).
